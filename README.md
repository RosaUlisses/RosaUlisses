## *ðŸ‘€ About Me*
My name is Ulisses, I am Computer Science student at UFMG (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais). I have a passion to studying computer theory and programming and I am always doing a small project to sharp my knowledge. My primary language is C++, but I can learn anyother. 
I love solving logical problems and developing my computational think. I believe that those skills will differ me from the great majority of developers.
<br>
Last but not least, my friends are my most precious treasure ðŸ¤Ž.
<br>

- Compilers
- Competitive programming
